# multi-agent-system
The general model consists of K predators and N preys and their interactions are modeled by an attraction-repulsion system. 

In the folder 'general model' we present the dynamics of predators and preys showing that they form different configurations depending on the choice of the attraction-repulsion parameters. In particular,  preys will aggregate in a stable or unstable ring and the predators are allowed either to oscillate inside the ring or to be expelled out. 

In the folder 'control' we show hot to drive the predators in order to give them advantages or disadvantages in their hunt.

In the last part, I have studied the preys-decay both in the case with and without control.
# general model
attraction repulsion model (predators-preys): one predator and N preys or two predators and N preys
# control
Control the predator dynamics
